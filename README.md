# gomaze

A Golang maze generator for having fun traversing graphs and encoding pngs

# Notes:
- The maze generator can take a bias input png that it will impact the maze that is generated (see below). All the generated mazes will be similar but not exactly the same

- Outputs are encoded to png (for now)
